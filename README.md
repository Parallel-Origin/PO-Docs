To actively help with development, you'll probably need to learn some basics first. Among them how the client, server and shared code base work together. That is what this [documentation ](./)is for.

Let's start with a little overview. The project consists of three parts. The client, the server and the core. They all work together with each other and are somewhat connected.\
\
You can find the repositorys here:\
\- [https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Server](https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Server)\
\- [https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Client](https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Client)\
\- [https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Core](https://github.com/Parallel-Origin/PO-Core)\
\
And the documentation here:\
\- [Server Docs](broken-reference)\
\- [Client Docs](broken-reference)\
\- [Core Docs](broken-reference)\

Are you ready? It won't be easy and you'll have to push through... so let's get started!
